# 2spherevis
Site is no longer live.

Visualisations of the links of the first vertex in the Regina examples triangulations L(8,3), & S2xS1 and the link of the only edge in the Regina example triangulation of a Cappel-Shaneson knot complement can be found in their respective directories.

Plans for the site include:
  - User interface to upload custom 2-spheres
  - Metadata visualization when a 2-sphere is the link of a vertex (3-manifold) or edge (4-manifold)
  
See the [sourceforge fork](https://sourceforge.net/u/smchurchill/regina/ci/webvis/tree/) for details on how the backend sphere-processing works.
